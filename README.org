This package provides

- functions to apply an ~emacs~ [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Custom-Themes.html][custom theme]] to current buffer only
- a macro to generate side-effect only functions as mode hooks 

The following screenshot shows one frame splits into 4 buffers (as /windows/ in
=emacs='s defintion), each buffer shows its own theme.

* Functions and macro 

** ~theme-anchor-buffer-local~

   This function applies a theme to the current buffer without affecting other buffers.

   The following example makes ~tange~ theme effective in current buffer without
   changing any face settings in other buffers. 

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp

     (theme-anchor-buffer-local 'tango)

   #+end_src 

   This function supports interactive mode through =M-x theme-anchor-buffer-local=
   
** ~theme-anchor-hook-gen~

   This macro generates functions those can setup mode-specific buffer
   appearance as well as turn on/off some  applicable features. 
    
   The following example shows how one can use this function to generate a
   mode hook function for ~emacs-lisp-mode~

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp

     (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook
	       (theme-anchor-hook-gen 'adwaita
                                      (show-paren-mode t)
                                      (setq-local show-paren-style 'expression)
                                      (electric-pair-local-mode t)))

   #+end_src 
    
** Other functions

*** ~theme-anchor-get-faces~

    This function extracts  ~theme-face~'s from a custom theme

*** ~theme-anchor-spec-choose~

    This function detects what settings are applicable in a face specification
    like:

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

      (theme-face default base16-default-light
                  ((((type graphic))
                    (:foreground "#383838" :background "#f8f8f8"))
                   (((min-colors 256))
                    (:foreground "white" :background "black"))
                    (t
                     (:foreground "white" :background "black"))))

    #+end_src 

    If the emacs process runs in a GUI environment, the first specification will
    be used as the ~(type graphic)~  requirement is satisified ; if it runs in 
    a tty terminal that only supports up to 16 colors, the third specification
    will be used due to even the second condition ~(min-colors 256)~ is not
    fulfilled. 
     
    Some themes may have some ~theme-face~ mis-specified like the following
    example, which more likely to be ~theme-value~ rather than ~theme-face~ 

    #+begin_src emacs-lisp

      (theme-face an-uncommon-face invalid-theme '(["#FFFFFA" "#AABBCC"]))

    #+end_src 

    If an invalid face specification is detected, this function will report an
    error and aborts any further execution of the function. 

*** =theme-anchor-get-values=
    Get =theme-values='s from a theme

*** =theme-anchor-set-values=
    Use =setq-local= to set =theme-value='s extracted from the them in the current buffer only 
    
* Limitations

  - +The ~theme-anchor-buffer-local~ currently does not support interactivefunction call yet+ 
  - +This package can only process ~theme-face~. ~theme-value~, which should be+
    +only changed via customization interface and that is out of this package's+
    +scope+ See [[https://github.com/GongYiLiao/theme-anchor/issues/1][Issue #1]]
  - +This package does not work well with modes basde on ~emacs-modules~ such+
     +as [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm][vterm]] using mode-hook mechanism to set themes. Interactively invoke+
     +~theme-anchor-buffer-local~ still works, but it requires manual+
     +operation for the time being.+  Note that setting ANSI color seems  
     not working in ~vterm~ when using [[https://fishshell.com/][fish]] that is due to fish's setting.
     Other shells, such as, Bash, do work partially. However, setting =term= and =term-color-*=
     via =face-remap-set-base= or =face-remap-add-relative=  seems
     not helpful in =ansi-term= and =vterm=.  =eshell= is less an issue as it has its own faces
     rather than inherits from =term=. Also see [[https://github.com/GongYiLiao/theme-anchor/issues/1][Issue #1.]] 
  - This package currently does not work well with some add-on themes such as
    [[https://github.com/AnthonyDiGirolamo/airline-themes][airline-themes]]



* Etymology

  This package and its functions' ~theme-anchor~ name prefix is chosen as a 
  theme gets anchored on a buffer rather than makes the entire ~Emacs~ session
  looks monotonic in style.
   
  The function =theme-anchor-buffer-local='s name suffix ~-buffer-local~ is borrowed
  from [[https://github.com/vic/color-theme-buffer-local][load-theme-buffer-local]] (which is unfortunately orphaned/looking for
  maintainer now) that I had used since ~Emacs~ version 26.1.
  =load-theme-buffer-local= relies on ~flet~ for dynamic binding but the deprecation
  of ~flet~ in recent Emacs releases and development branches prevents it from
  working properly even with [[https://github.com/nicferrier/emacs-noflet][noflet]]. This package aims to solve the same problem
  ~load-theme-buffer-local~ aimed to solve but without use of dynamic binding
  as well as any third-party package dependency.
